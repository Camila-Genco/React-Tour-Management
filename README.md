## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- ⚙️ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- 📦 [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- 🗃️ [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed and running OR a [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/) account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Camila-Genco/tour-management.git your-project-name

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-project-name

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start

### Some other scripts

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

`npm run eject`

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
